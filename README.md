# Degree 53 Core ESLint Config

This config is dependent on `v2.7.0` of `eslint` being installed to your `./node_modules`.

Your `.eslintrc` file should be at the same level as your `./node_modules` and should contain the following:

``` javascript
{
	"extends": [
		"degree53-core"
	]
}
```

For an explanation of the rules please see the [ESLint documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).
